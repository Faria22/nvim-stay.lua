## nvim-stay.lua - Complete Implementation

This is a full Lua implementation of the vim-stay plugin for Neovim, maintaining API compatibility while leveraging Lua for better performance.

## Implemented Features

### Core Functionality
✅ Automatic view session creation on buffer events
✅ Automatic view session restoration on buffer load
✅ Smart buffer persistence detection with heuristics
✅ Temporary file filtering (via backupskip)
✅ Volatile file type filtering
✅ Preview and diff window exclusion
✅ View directory management and cleanup

### Configuration
✅ `g:volatile_ftypes` - List of file types to never persist
✅ `g:stay_verbosity` - Error message verbosity control (-1, 0, 1)
✅ Compatible with 'viewoptions' and 'viewdir' settings

### Commands
✅ `:CleanViewdir[!] [days]` - Clean up view directory
✅ `:StayReload[!]` - Reload integrations/plugin

### Integration API
✅ `b:stay_ignore` - Mark buffer as non-persistent
✅ `b:stay_atpos` - Set custom cursor position after view load
✅ `b:stay_loaded_view` - Path to loaded view file

### Autocommand Events
✅ `BufStayLoadPre` - Before loading view
✅ `BufStayLoadPost` - After loading view
✅ `BufStaySavePre` - Before saving view
✅ `BufStaySavePost` - After saving view

## Testing Results

All core functionality has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Plugin loads correctly in Neovim
- ✅ Commands are registered properly
- ✅ Cursor position persistence works
- ✅ View files are created and restored
- ✅ CleanViewdir command works
- ✅ Volatile file types are correctly ignored
- ✅ Temporary files (in backupskip) are ignored

## Compatibility

- Neovim (tested with 0.9.5)
- Compatible with original vim-stay API
- Same configuration variables and commands
- Same buffer variables for integration

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Persistence Heuristics**: Files must be:
   - Named (not empty buffer)
   - Listed buffers
   - Regular file or acwrite buftype
   - Not in temporary directories (backupskip)
   - Not of volatile file type
   - Readable on disk

2. **View Session Management**:
   - Automatically removes 'options' flag from viewoptions during save
   - Triggers User autocommands for plugin integration
   - Handles errors gracefully with configurable verbosity

3. **Performance**:
   - Debounces view saves (1 second cooldown)
   - Uses efficient Lua code
   - Native Neovim API integration

## Documentation

- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Neovim help documentation (`:help nvim-stay`)
- Example configuration file
- Changelog with version history

## Next Steps for Users

1. Install the plugin using their preferred method
2. Add recommended viewoptions settings to config
3. Optionally customize volatile_ftypes
4. Use `:CleanViewdir` periodically to manage view directory

The plugin works automatically in the background with no user intervention required.
